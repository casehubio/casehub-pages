/**
 * Real interaction tests for form + table combinations.
 *
 * These tests previously drove PagesTable shadow DOM elements directly
 * (click table cells, type in the filter box). PagesTable has been
 * removed from pages-viz in favour of pages-data-table in blocks-ui.
 *
 * The form ↔ data-component interaction is covered by form-integration.test.ts
 * which dispatches pages-filter events programmatically (no table shadow DOM).
 * Full interaction tests should be added once pages-data-table is wired
 * into the runtime.
