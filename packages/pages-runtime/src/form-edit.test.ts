/**
 * Real interaction tests for editing + saving via local adapter.
 *
 * These tests previously relied on PagesTable shadow DOM interaction
 * (clicking table rows, reading table cell text). PagesTable has been
 * removed from pages-viz in favour of pages-data-table in blocks-ui.
 *
 * The form editing and local save adapter are tested at the unit level
 * in their respective modules. Integration tests that exercise the
 * full edit → save → re-push cycle through a data-consuming component
 * should be added once pages-data-table is wired into the runtime.
